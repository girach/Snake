About the game:

This game has two versions
	1. Casual game --- Snake size increases as it consumes.
	2. Same game with an enemy snake which always tries to catch food before you can. To make things more difficult and interesting,
		i) The enemy snake can crawl both upon itself and the player snake whereas player snake can't crawl over itself leading to knot(may be :p) and ending the game.
		ii) The enemy snake's size won't increase whereas player snake's size will keep on increasing as it consumes (and here the above condition brings trouble).

Note: This game isn't a creation of mine as a whole, main idea was from a tutorial on pygame module. I added some additional features to the game.
